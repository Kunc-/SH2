    <h1>Sacred Heart Scavenger Hunt</h1>
    <p> Year 6, welcome to the ultimate (ish) scavenger hunt. DO NOT PRESS THE START BUTTON UNTIL YOU ARE TOLD TO, or your time will start early.</p>
    <h3>Instructions/Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When instructed, press the start button. You will be taken to this page, and the timer will start:
            <img style="border: 20px white" src="resources/example.png" width="400px"></li>
        <li>Each item has a riddle, a number of points and a box for the code to be entered in.</li>
        <li>Codes are random five number (positive) sequences, such as 12345 or 00000. </li>
        <li>Entry of the correct code in to the correct riddle will earn you the stated number of points.</li>
        <li>When your time expires, return to Year 6. The program will not accept entries after that time.</li>
        <li>NO RUNNING (especially on slippery surfaces)</li>
        <li>You should not share your codes with anyone outside your team. It's unsporting.</li>
        <li>You should not move codes - anyone doing so will be disqualified.</li>
        <li>No Bull-dogging (following one team to find all their codes).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Restrictions on Code Placement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>There are no codes anywhere that you'd have to go through rain to get - please don't get yourself soaked</li>
        <li>There are no codes outside the school, or in bathrooms.</li>
        <li>There are no codes that require you to enter any buildings.</li>
        <li>There may be codes hidden in rooms that you aren't allowed to go into, but which are easily visible from the outside.</li>
        <li>There are no codes in stupid places, such as in gardens, on roofs, or in cars.</li>
    </ul>
    <button type="button" onclick="window.location.href='game.html'" style="position:relative;left:40%;" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary text-center center-block">Start</button>
